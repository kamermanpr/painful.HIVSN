library(knitr)
library(MASS) # Ordinal logistic regression (output can be used by MuMIn)
library(MuMIn) # Model subset selection
    options(na.action = na.fail) # Setting for MuMIn (requires complete dataset)
library(rms) # Same as MASS::polr, but better model fit indicators

               tidy = FALSE)
```

## Load data
```{r import_data}
data <- read_csv('./data/pain-intensity.csv')
```

## Quick look
```{r quick_look}
dim(data)
names(data)
head(data)
tail(data)
glimpse(data)
summary(data)
```

## Process data
```{r process_data}
data <- data %>%
    mutate(pain_intensity = factor(pain_intensity, ordered = TRUE), # Convert 'pain_intensity' to an ordered factor
           tb = factor(tb)) %>% # Convert 'tb' to a factor
    filter(complete.cases(.)) # Retain complete cases only
```

## Build model
### Ordinal logistic regression
```{r ordinal_logistic}
# Ordinal logistic regression on full model (all variables p<0.1 on univariate analysis, 
# number of pain sites, mean depression score, mean anxiety score, PCS score, and 
# whether currently on treatment for TB).
# Pain intensity as an ordinal measure ("data" data.frame).
# Select best model using Akaike's information criterion (AIC).

# Model
## Use MASS::polr for this step because output is compatible with MuMIn
mod.olr <- polr(pain_intensity ~ pain_sites + 
               hscl_depression_score +
               hscl_anxiety_score +
               pcs +
               tb, 
           data = data.olr,
           Hess=T)
# Model summary 
summary(mod.olr)

# Use "dredge" to select best models based on AIC
dredge.olr <- dredge(mod.olr, beta = FALSE, evaluate = TRUE, rank = "AIC")

# Build a model selection table
mod.olr.sel <- model.sel(dredge.olr)

# Subset those models that show an change in AIC 
# of 2 or less (not different from each other)
get.mod.olr <- get.models(mod.olr.sel, subset = delta < 2)
get.mod.olr

# Average across the subsetted models
mod.avg.olr <- model.avg(get.mod.olr)
summary(mod.avg.olr)
# Made a priori choice to only take variables that occur in >50% of models
# OUTCOME: hscl_depression_score and pain_sites occur in all 5 models
# OUTCOME: Current treatment for tb found in 3/5 models
# OUTCOME: Take 'hscl_depression_score, pain_sites, tb through to 
# next stage of analysis

# New model
## Use rms::lrm for this stage because better fit 
## indicators than MASS::polr
attach(data.olr)
d <- datadist(hscl_depression_score, 
              pain_sites, 
              tb)
detach(data.olr)
options(datadist = "d")
mod.olr.new<-lrm(pain_intensity ~ hscl_depression_score +
                     pain_sites + 
                     tb, 
              data = data.olr, 
              x = TRUE, y = TRUE, 
              linear.predictors = TRUE)

# Model summary
mod.olr.new
summary(mod.olr.new)
# Plot outcome with anova results
plot(Predict(mod.olr.new), 
     anova = anova(mod.olr.new),
     pval = TRUE)

# OUTCOME: Model is significantly better than null model (p = 0.007), 
# OUTCOME: Poor predictive value: Nagelkerke R^2 = 0.09, C (AUROC) = 0.63
# OUTCOME: hscl_depression_score, pain_sites, and tb were all 
# independent risk factors
# OUTCOME: Increasing depression score => increased pain intensity
# OUTCOME: Increasing number of pain sites  => increased pain intenisty. 
# OUTCOME: Being treated for TB => reduced pain intensity

# Validate measures of fit using bootstrap sampling (B=999)
validate(mod.olr.new, 
         method = "boot", 
         B=999, 
         group = data.olr$pain_intensity)
# OUTCOME: see "index.corrected" for bootstrapped measures

# Test for multicolinearity using variance inflation factor (vif)
vif(mod.olr.new) # >4 is a problem
# OUTCOME: No evidence of multicolinearity between predictors
